# Icon Placeholder Files

Since this is a text-based environment, I cannot create actual PNG icon files. 

You'll need to create three icon files for your Chrome extension:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels  
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels

These should be simple, clear icons representing your extension (perhaps a document with a summary symbol, or LinkedIn's logo with an AI indicator).

You can create these using any image editor or find free icons online. Make sure they follow Chrome's extension icon guidelines:
- Use simple, recognizable designs
- Ensure they look good at small sizes
- Use appropriate contrast and colors

For now, the extension will work without these icons, but Chrome will show a default placeholder.
